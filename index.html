    <h1>Bloom Filters</h1>
    <p>
      A Bloom Filter is a space-efficient probabilistic data structure design to
      test whether a given element is a member of a set or not. Bloom Filters
      use multiple hash functions and a compact array of bits to represent the
      set. The primary advantage of a Bloom Filter is its ability to quickly
      tell whether an element is definitely not in the set or might be in the
      set.
    </p>

    <p>
      However, there is a trade-off. Bloom Filters may produce false positives,
      indicating that an element is in the set when it is not. False negatives
      (indicating that an element is not in the set when it is) do not occur.
